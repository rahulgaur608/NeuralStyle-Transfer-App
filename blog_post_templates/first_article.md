## Introduction

Hello, I'm [Rahul Gaur](https://github.com/rahulgaur608), a software engineer specializing in Python and automation tools. In this article, I'll walk you through how I built the [Auto Commit Scheduler](https://github.com/rahulgaur608/auto-commit-scheduler), a tool that helps developers maintain a consistent GitHub contribution graph.

Whether you're looking to showcase your coding consistency to potential employers or simply want to ensure you don't break your streak during busy periods, this tool can be incredibly useful. I'll explain the technical implementation, challenges faced, and provide the complete code so you can try it yourself.

## The Problem I Wanted to Solve

As a developer, I understand the importance of maintaining an active GitHub profile. Consistent contributions demonstrate:

1. Regular coding practice
2. Ongoing learning and improvement
3. Dedication to your craft
4. Active participation in the development community

However, there are legitimate reasons why your contribution graph might have gaps:

- Working on private repositories
- Contributing to projects not hosted on GitHub
- Taking time off for personal reasons
- Working on long-term projects with infrequent commits

## The Solution: Auto Commit Scheduler

I developed a Python-based tool that allows you to:

- Schedule commits for specific dates
- Customize commit patterns
- Maintain your contribution streak during periods when you can't actively commit
- Fill in historical gaps in your contribution graph

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies Used

- **Python**: For the main application logic
- **Git API**: For handling repository operations
- **Scheduling Library**: For timing the commits
- **Configuration Management**: For user settings

### Key Components

#### 1. Repository Setup

```python
def setup_repository(repo_path, remote_url=None):
    """
    Set up a Git repository for automated commits.
    
    Args:
        repo_path (str): Path to the repository
        remote_url (str, optional): URL of the remote repository
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if setup was successful
    """
    try:
        # Initialize repository if it doesn't exist
        if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(repo_path, '.git')):
            subprocess.run(['git', 'init', repo_path], check=True)
            
        # Set up remote if provided
        if remote_url:
            os.chdir(repo_path)
            subprocess.run(['git', 'remote', 'add', 'origin', remote_url], check=True)
            
        return True
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error setting up repository: {e}")
        return False
```

#### 2. Commit Generation

```python
def create_commit(repo_path, date_str, message="Update documentation"):
    """
    Create a commit with a specified date.
    
    Args:
        repo_path (str): Path to the repository
        date_str (str): Date string in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
        message (str): Commit message
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if commit was successful
    """
    try:
        os.chdir(repo_path)
        
        # Create or update a file
        with open(os.path.join(repo_path, 'activity.log'), 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"Activity logged on {date_str}\n")
            
        # Stage the file
        subprocess.run(['git', 'add', 'activity.log'], check=True)
        
        # Create commit with specified date
        env = os.environ.copy()
        env['GIT_AUTHOR_DATE'] = f"{date_str}T12:00:00"
        env['GIT_COMMITTER_DATE'] = f"{date_str}T12:00:00"
        
        subprocess.run(['git', 'commit', '-m', message], env=env, check=True)
        return True
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error creating commit: {e}")
        return False
```

#### 3. Scheduling System

```python
def schedule_commits(repo_path, start_date, end_date, pattern='daily'):
    """
    Schedule commits according to a pattern.
    
    Args:
        repo_path (str): Path to the repository
        start_date (str): Start date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
        end_date (str): End date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
        pattern (str): Commit pattern ('daily', 'weekdays', 'weekends', 'custom')
        
    Returns:
        int: Number of commits scheduled
    """
    start = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(start_date)
    end = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(end_date)
    current = start
    commit_count = 0
    
    while current <= end:
        current_date = current.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        
        # Apply pattern logic
        should_commit = False
        if pattern == 'daily':
            should_commit = True
        elif pattern == 'weekdays':
            should_commit = current.weekday() < 5  # Monday to Friday
        elif pattern == 'weekends':
            should_commit = current.weekday() >= 5  # Saturday and Sunday
        
        if should_commit:
            if create_commit(repo_path, current_date):
                commit_count += 1
                
        current += datetime.timedelta(days=1)
        
    return commit_count
```

## Challenges and Solutions

During development, I encountered several challenges:

### 1. Git Date Manipulation

**Challenge**: Git uses both author and committer dates, and changing these retrospectively requires special handling.

**Solution**: I used environment variables `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` and `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` to set custom dates for commits.

### 2. Maintaining Authenticity

**Challenge**: Automated commits should still represent meaningful activity.

**Solution**: Instead of empty commits, the tool creates or updates an activity log file, making each commit represent actual file changes.

### 3. Avoiding Detection

**Challenge**: GitHub might flag suspicious commit patterns.

**Solution**: I implemented randomized commit times and variable commit messages to make the activity appear more natural.

## How to Use the Tool

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulgaur608/auto-commit-scheduler.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your settings:
   ```bash
   python setup.py --name "Your Name" --email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

4. Schedule commits:
   ```bash
   python scheduler.py --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-01-31 --pattern daily
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   python push.py
   ```

## Ethical Considerations

While this tool can help maintain your contribution streak during legitimate periods of absence, I want to emphasize that it should be used ethically:

- Use it to represent work you're actually doing but not capturing on GitHub
- Don't use it to misrepresent your activity to potential employers
- Consider it a tool for consistency, not for fabrication

## Conclusion

Building the Auto Commit Scheduler was both a fun technical challenge and a useful tool for my own development workflow. The project taught me valuable lessons about Git internals, Python automation, and ethical considerations in developer tools.
