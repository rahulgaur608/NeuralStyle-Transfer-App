</div>

**Filename recommendation**: Use your full name in the image file before uploading (e.g., `rahul_gaur_professional_headshot.jpg`).

### 2. Background Banner

Create a custom banner that:
- Represents your professional brand
- Includes your name and title
- Features a relevant image related to software engineering
- Contains your contact information or website URL
- Uses professional colors (blue tones work well for tech professionals)

**Recommended dimensions**: 1584 x 396 pixels

### 3. Headline Optimization

Your headline is crucial for LinkedIn SEO. Instead of just "Software Engineer," use this formula:

```
[Job Title] | [Key Specialization] | [Unique Value Proposition]
```

**Current headline**: Software Engineer

**Optimized headline**: "Software Engineer & Full-Stack Developer | Python & JavaScript Expert | Building Automation Tools That Save Developers Time"

This headline:
- Contains important keywords
- Clearly states your specialization
- Includes your unique value proposition
- Is more likely to appear in search results

### 4. Custom URL

**Current URL**: linkedin.com/in/[random-characters]

**Optimized URL**: linkedin.com/in/rahulgaur608

Having your name in your LinkedIn URL improves SEO both within LinkedIn and on Google.

### 5. About Section

## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPic2BnoVZkRla8/giphy.gif" width="28"> Sample First Post

```
I'm excited to share my latest project: Auto Commit Scheduler, a tool I built to help developers maintain consistent GitHub contribution graphs.

As software engineers, we often work on projects that aren't reflected in our public GitHub activity—whether it's private repositories, non-GitHub projects, or periods when we're learning rather than committing code.

This Python-based tool allows you to:
• Schedule commits for specific dates
• Customize commit patterns
• Fill in historical gaps in your contribution graph
• Maintain your streak during periods when you can't actively commit

I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvements!
